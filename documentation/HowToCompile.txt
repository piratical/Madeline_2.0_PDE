Notes on Compiling Madeline

Required Tools
==============

The following software tools are required before you can
build Madeline:

1. GIT: https://git-scm.com/

You may need an GIT client in order to checkout the latest code
from our code repository.  Please review the instructions on
Githube for information on how to checkout the code from
GIT:



2. CMake: http://cmake.org/

The CMake build system is used instead of the GNU automake and
autoconf system that you may be more familiar with.  Once you 
have checked out Madeline, enter the Madeline directory and run
ccmake in order to configure interactively.  Be sure to include
the "." indicating the current directory:

~> cd madeline2
~> ccmake .

CCMake is a curses configuration client.  You can also use the
command-line client, cmake :

~> cmake .


Required Libraries
==================

1. LibXML2

   This is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project.
   If you are using Linux, this will probably be already installed
   on your system.  If not, download from:
   
   http://xmlsoft.org/

2. Pango
   
   Pango is a library for laying out and rendering internationalized text.
   It is used as part of Gnome, so it may already be available on your system
   if you have Gnome or GTK+-based software such as the Gimp installed.
   Pango itself depends on GTK+'s GLIB library.  Be sure to build Pango
   with FreeType2 support.  FreeType 2 should already be on your system.

   http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pango/

3. LASi

   The LASi library provides a C++ stream output interface for creating 
   Postscript documents that can contain characters from any of the scripts 
   and symbol blocks supported in Unicode  and by the Pango layout engine:
   
   http://unifont.org/lasi/
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/lasi
   
   Note that LASi also uses the CMake build system.
   
   Check out the latest code from the Sourceforge SVN repository.  The
   latest code and build system now automatically deals with the FreeType 2
   API changes for you so you no longer have to worry about which version
   of FreeType 2 you have.  In general, FreeType 2 should already be on
   your system unless you are building on a platform like Windows or Mac OS
   X.  

   Detailed information about building LASi on different platforms is
   provided on the http://unifont.org/lasi website.  These instructions
   should also help you succeed in building Madeline on various platforms.


GCC Compiler
============

By default, the CMake build system will look for a working GCC
compiler.  Development takes place using GCC v. 4.0.2 or newer.
The code should compile using somewhat older versions as well, but
if you encounter troubles we recommend upgrading to a recent
version of GCC.

Intel ICC Compiler
==================

You need to tell CMake if you want to use Intel's ICC compiler.
Be sure to provide the actual paths to the icc and icpc executables.
Depending on your platform and how you install ICC, you might have
symbolic links in /usr/bin or in /usr/local/bin, or you might even
have to specify the full path in /opt/intel/... :

~> CC=/usr/bin/icc CXX=/usr/bin/icpc ccmake .

... or:

~> CC=/usr/bin/icc CXX=/usr/bin/icpc cmake .

*** IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS ***
============================


SVN PROBLEMS
============

We have on occasion experienced problems with SVN when attempting
to check out or commit code on certain platforms (such as OS X) or 
when using certain terminals (such as mlterm).  Exporting the
following environmental variables normally fixes the problems:

export TERM=vt100
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

In the first line above, we set the terminal type (TERM) to 
vt100.  When committing code, SVN by default calls the vi editor
so the user can write a comment about the commit.  It is fairly
safe to assume that most versions of vi will know about "vt100"
terminal capabilities even if they don't know about more esoteric
terminals like mlterm.

In the second line above, we set the LANG locale variable to
an American English UTF-8 locale.  Actually *any* UTF-8 locale
will do.  It does not have to be English.  But it does have to
be a UTF-8 Unicode encoding.


COMPILATION PROBLEMS
====================

If you have problems, a good approach is to build a "clean" set of
all of the dependent libraries from source and install them in an 
isolated directory, for example:

     /opt/madeline2
     
In this case "dependent libraries" may include Pango's and FreeType's
dependencies.  The whole list of dependencies is:

  * FontConfig
  * GLib
  * FreeType2
  * Pango
  * libXML2
  * LASi
  
For libraries using the AUTOCONF build system, the usual procedure
for specifying a non-default prefix is to run ./configure like this:

  ./configure --prefix=/opt/madeline2
  
LASi and Madeline use the CMAKE build system.  One way to specify 
the install prefix is to run "ccmake ." from the top-level directory
and then change the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX interactively. The curses-based 
CMAKE configuration client will display a screen something like the 
following:

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                                                      
 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /usr/local <== ***
 EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH                                                
 GETTEXT_MSGFMT_EXECUTABLE        /usr/bin/msgfmt                      
 GETTEXT_MSGMERGE_EXECUTABLE      /usr/bin/msgmerge                    
 LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH                                                   
 WITH_MYSQLPP_SUPPORT             OFF                                  
 libcrypto                        /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so              
 libssl                           /usr/lib64/libssl.so                 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, simply change the entry for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
from "/usr/local" to "/opt/madeline2" (or your choice of installation
path).

In order to guarantee that the AUTOCONF or CMAKE build systems find
the right paths, be sure to export the following environment variables
*before* running ./configure or ./cmake . :

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/madeline2/lib/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/madeline2/lib

This insures that the build systems find the libraries that have 
been newly-installed in "/opt/madeline2" first (rather than finding
potentially incompatible older libraries already present on the system).
